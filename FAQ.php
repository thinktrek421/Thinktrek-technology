                           EPR Plan is an implementation plan of the producer where the producer gives its overall scheme to fulfil its Extended Producer Responsibility for achieving targets and details out the mechanism for collection and channelisation of e-waste generated by him. 
                           The EPR plan requires estimating the quantity of E-waste generated from their end-of-life products, outlining a scheme for collection and channelization of their end-of-life products or products with same EEE code to authorised dismantlers/recyclers, estimated budget for implementing EPR, outline the scheme of creating awareness, declaration on ROHS compliance and submission of documents. To make EPR Plan complete the producer is required to ensure that all the e- waste collected should be finally sent to authorised recycler
